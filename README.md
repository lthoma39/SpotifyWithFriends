# SpotifyWithFriends

### App Description
Ever went on a car ride with friends and you were stuck listening to their crappy music since they were in charge of the AUX chord/music?
SpotifyWithFriends is the app for you. With SpotifyWithFriends you'll be able to play your favorite playlist and you + your friends will be
able to skip or replay previous songs.

### More Info
This is my first android app outside of my mobile app course and also my first time using an API such as the Spotify API.
Since I'm in school still I will try my best to work on this app as often as I can. Any major progress I make I will post gifs of the
progress so that we can see the app from start to finish.
